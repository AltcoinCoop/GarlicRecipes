# Garlium (Electrum) Wallet
The Electrum wallet is cross-platform, you can install it on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Windows
**Make sure that you have deleted your %AppData%/Garlium folder before installing!**
Download this [installer](http://f.ske.wtf/garlium/garlium-setup.exe) and install it. You should be good to go.  
Thanks to `@Ske#6201` for the Windows Port!

## Mac
Mac and Linux builds are not yet available, you should try one of the other wallets instead (for now).  
If you wish to build it yourself, you can try this [Mac building guide](https://pastebin.com/U5dmBJEN) by `@Zee3658`.

## Linux
Mac and Linux builds are not yet available, you should try one of the other wallets instead (for now).  
If you wish to build it yourself, you can follow the steps from this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/xSke/garlium) by `@Ske#6201`.  

## Note
If these don't work or you prefer to use the official wallet (which is a bit harder to use), then follow the other Wallet guides.
